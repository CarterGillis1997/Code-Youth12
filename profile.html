          I took a 3D design class in highschool in which i used the programs "AutoCAD, Revit, and Inventor". Since AutoCAD programmes are so expensive i started learning to use blender. I frequently try to model difficult things to challenge
          myself and learn new skills. I also have had to learn skills for texturing and shading. Recently i learned how to use the sculpting tools.In highschool i learned the coding language Turing, It is a very simple coding language that is
          very limited in it capabilities but tought me important skills that will hopefully help me in future coding.

          I recently bought a Nintendo Switch and have been catching up on the games that i missed in the past 7 years. The first game i bought was Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate which is very fun and has the most monsters of any other
          monster hunter game (i think).
